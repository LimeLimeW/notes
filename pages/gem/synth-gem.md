# GEM Video Synthesis

A simple way to perform video synthesis in [[Pure Data]] is to use the `pix_sig2pix~` object from the GEM library.

The use of this object is simple. It is based on 4 inlets : 
- The first one takes a `gemlist`. This means that we have to send data of type `gemlist`, generated by GEM objects. Thus, as input we can use a `gemhead`, which gives the beginning of a rendering chain. We can always insert on this first inlet a `dimen` dimension message (length and width) which will set the dimension of the output object to the `pix_texture` object. Finally, on this first inlet, we can enter the first signal that will control the red color channel. 
- The second inlet corresponds to the green color channel. 
- The third inlet corresponds to the blue color channel. 
- The fourth inlet corresponds to the alpha channel, which will define the transparency. 

The outlet is obviously in the form of a Gemlist.

The patch above produces the following result:

Here, an `osc~` type signal (generating a cosine signal) is input to the red channel. The green channel receives a `noise~` signal (uniformly distributed white noise). Finally, the blue channel receives a `phasor~` signal, which corresponds to a sawtooth signal. An `atom` (an object to adjust a value, which can be connected to an inlet) has been added here to `osc~` and `phasor~` to adjust the frequency of the signals. 

By adjusting a little and activating the `noise~` signal, you can get this result:
